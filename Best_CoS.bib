  abstract = {Global positioning systems (GPSs) and geographical information systems (GISs) have been widely used to collect and synthesize spatial data from a variety of sources. New advances in satellite imagery and remote sensing now permit scientists to access spatial data at several different resolutions. The Internet facilitates fast and easy data acquisition. In any one study, several different types of data may be collected at differing scales and resolutions, at different spatial locations, and in different dimensions. Many statistical issues are associated with combining such data for modeling and inference. This article gives an overview of these issues and the approaches for integrating such disparate data, drawing on work from geography, ecology, agriculture, geology, and statistics. Emphasis is on state-of-the-art statistical solutions to this complex and important problem.},

  title = {Resolving Misaligned Spatial Data with Integrated Species Distribution Models},
  volume = {0},
  issn = {1939-9170},
  abstract = {Advances in species distribution modeling continue to be driven by a need to predict species responses to environmental change coupled with increasing data availability. Recent work has focused on development of methods that integrate multiple streams of data to model species distributions. Combining sources of information increases spatial coverage and can improve accuracy in estimates of species distributions. However, when fusing multiple streams of data, the temporal and spatial resolutions of data sources may be mismatched. This occurs when data sources have fluctuating geographic coverage, varying spatial scales and resolutions, and differing sources of bias and sparsity. It is well documented in the spatial statistics literature that ignoring the misalignment of different data sources will result in bias in both the point estimates and uncertainty. This will ultimately lead to inaccurate predictions of species distributions. Here, we examine the issue of misaligned data as it relates specifically to integrated species distribution models. We then provide a general solution that builds off work in the statistical literature for the change of support problem. Specifically, we leverage spatial correlation and repeat observations at multiple scales to make statistically valid predictions at the ecologically relevant scale of inference. An added feature of the approach is that addressing differences in spatial resolution between data sets can allow for the evaluation and calibration of lesser quality sources in many instances. Using both simulations and data examples, we highlight the utility of this modeling approach and the consequences of not reconciling misaligned spatial data. We conclude with a brief discussion of the upcoming challenges and obstacles for species distribution modeling via data fusion. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal change of support (STCOS) methods are designed for statistical inference and prediction on spatial and/or temporal domains which differ from the domains on which the data were observed. Bradley, Wikle, and Holan (2015; Stat) introduced a parsimonious class of Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models for STCOS for Gaussian data through a motivating application involving the American Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau that measures key socioeconomic and demographic variables for various populations in the United States. Importantly, their methodology provides ACS data-users a principled approach to estimating variables of interest, along with associated measures of uncertainty, on customized geographies and/or time periods. In this work, we develop an R package to make the methodology broadly accessible to federal statistical agencies, such as the Census Bureau, the ACS data-user community, and to the general R-user community. The package is illustrated through a detailed case-study based on real data.},
