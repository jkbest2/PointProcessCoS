In some cases we may have information on different scales that can inform our estimates of parameters of interest such as abundance. For these to inform our model, we need to relate them to a common underlying process. In the statistics literature, this is known as a *change of support* problem (Gotway and Young 2002). A simple case occurs when it can be assumed that abundance scales linearly with area, in which case an offset can account for different areas. In a spatially explicit model we account for spatial correlation between observations, but we may also need to account for observations that take place over different geometries. For example, we may have estimates of the total abundance of an area, as well as observations of individual locations within subareas.

The general strategy in change of support problems is to model the process at as fine a scale as possible, and then consider areal observations as integrals over a subarea. Here we model the abundance intensity ($N(s)$) as a continuous process across the domain. This allows direct modeling of the point process. Total abundance estimates, being observed over the entire domain, depend on the integral of the abundance intensity over the domain.

We denote the domain of interest \(\Omega\). Within this area we consider the locations of individuals to be random, with some areas used more intensely than others. This is known as an inhomogeneous Poisson process, and we model it using a log-Gaussian Cox process (LGCP). Note that for simplicity we do not include the detection and sampling processes here. The log-Gaussian Cox process is defined by an intensity function $\Lambda(s)$, so that

\[\log \Lambda(s) = \vec{X}\vec{\beta} + \epsilon(s),\]

where $\vec{X}(s)\vec{\beta}$ informs the expected log-intensity through
covariates $\vec{X}$. Here we simplify to a constant global mean. The second term, \(\epsilon(s)\), is a Gaussian random field with mean zero and precision matrix \(\vec{Q}\), so that

$$\vec{\epsilon} \sim \operatorname{MVN}\left( \vec{0}, \vec{Q}^{-1} \right).$$

The Gaussian random field can account for variation that is not explained by the included covariates.

Computationally, we must deal with a finite representation of $\Lambda(s)$. We divide $\Omega$ into small polygons, which we will call the $\omega_i$. Each $\omega_i$ has area \(a_i\). The number of points that fall within each \(\omega_i\) is distributed as

\[n_i \sim \operatorname{Poisson}\left(\int_{\omega_i} \Lambda(s) ds \right).\]

To change our level observation to the entire area, we need to calculate the total expected number of individuals observed. This is the integral

\[\Lambda_{tot} = \int_\Omega \Lambda(s) ds\]

so that we have

\[N_t \sim \operatorname{Poisson}(\Lambda_{tot}).\]

This gives a likelihood

$$\mathcal{L}\left( \vec{N}, \vec{n}; \vec{\beta}, \vec{\epsilon} \right) =
  \prod_t p(N_t) \prod_i p(n_t) p(\vec{\epsilon}),$$
  
where each $p(\cdot)$ is the density function of the distributions defined above. By paying attention to the scale that our observations are taken at, we can reconstruct the intensity of spatial habitat use. Compare the model used to simulate the data (left) with the fitted surface (right). Including the point observations allows us to see more of the spatial structure than if we had used only the estimate of total abundance.
